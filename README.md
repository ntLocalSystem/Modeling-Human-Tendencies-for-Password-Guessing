# Modeling-Human-Tendencies-for-Password-Guessing

Passwords form a predominant part of all authentication mechanisms and likely will not be replaced soon, primarily because of their ease of use and straightforwardness. Humangenerated passwords are particularly susceptible to guessing attacks as a consequence of the limitation of precise recall and hence are not random. In this paper, we make use of the excellent expressive power of sequence modeling neural networks such as LSTMs and GRUs to effectively guess passwords as compared to other state-of-the-art password guessing techniques such as Markov Models, JtR and PCFGs. LSTM and GRU models were able to match about 55% of the testing set when evaluated on the Rockyou dataset. This proves that sequence modeling neural networks can effectively learn the distribution of real passwords from previously leaked datasets.
